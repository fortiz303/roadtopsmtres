Q: How can NFR's be made transparent? What are some techniques to maanage NFR's? How would we know that the work is being done?

A: NFR are vital to the success of the product and of the Team. For NFR's to be transparent, we could add them to the DoD. We could manage NFR's by adding them to the PB. To make sure that NFR's are being done we make sure that every increment meets those NFR's. It is the developer's responsibility that they implement those NFR's.
