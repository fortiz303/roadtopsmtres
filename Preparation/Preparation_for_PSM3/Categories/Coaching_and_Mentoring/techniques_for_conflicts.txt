Q: When conflict arises what role does the SM play? What tecniques does he employ? If the team stays in conflict what should the SM do?

A: Scrum's values of Focus, Respect, Openneness, Courage, and Commitment come into play when dealing with conflict resolution. The SM plays the role of somebody who can facilitate tough conversations between team members; the SM fosters an environment where conflict can give way to great ideas and products. As a SM, I encourage conflict between team members because that lets me know that they are involved. In addition, this will foster growth and effectiveness.

In the case that the team can not solve the conflict, I would consider this an impediment that hinders the progress of the team. Again, this is after I've exhausted personal coaching, conflict resolution meetings, coffee meetups. At this point, I would ask for help from the organization in resolving this. This could bethat one of the team members involved in the conflict moves to another team.
