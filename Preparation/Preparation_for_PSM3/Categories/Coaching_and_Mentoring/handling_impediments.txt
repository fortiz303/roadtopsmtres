Q: The team does not have the expertise and knowledge to complete the work planned for the next Sprint? How do you as the SM handle it?

A: As the SM, I will act and help to remove the impediment by asking if the expertise is really needed? Ask the team how how, as cross-functional team, we could gain the knowledge needed. During Sprint Planning, outside experts may be consulted by the team. Talking to the PO about finding another approach or changing scope could help. Also, a third party could help but I would coach the team to not rely on their help to eliminate or minimize external help as much as possible.If all else fails, the SM can help the team get the needed expertise from inside/outside the organization to help them.

My answer: I would help them in the following ways: Ask is the expertise really needed? I'd cousult with the PO and check if we could change the approach or the scope. If the expertise, is really needed, ask the team as a x-functional team how we coul d gain the expertise needed. During SP, I'd invite external help at the request of the Team. However, I would remind the team, being x-functional, that external help should be minimized as much as possible or eliminated.
