What aspects of Scrum helps a ST self manage? How does each aspect support self managing?

A: The following helps a ST self-manage: Cross functional teams, artifact commitments (PG,SG,DoD), Timeboxes, Artifact transparency.

Cross-functional teams reduces the need for depending on external people for value creation. This enables the team to make decisions locally within the team.

Artifact commitments (product goal, sprint goal, Definition of Done) creates a focus that helps the Scrum team to work together.

Timeboxes encourages team members to focus on the same problem at the same time to create the best possible result in the time allocated, given the current context.

Artifact transparency provides the team the ability to effectively insect and adapt without the need to depend on external people.

The Developers creating their own sprint backlog and deciding how the work will be performed.

The Developers deciding how to progress towards the sprint goal at the daily scrum. Embodying the Scrum values build trust between team members creating a foundation for self-management.

My answer: The cross-functionality of the team, Scrum Events. Scrum Values, timeboxing, and the Artifacts help the team self manage.

First off, embodying the SV helps build trust between the team members creating foundation for self-management. (Add the rest in your own words)
