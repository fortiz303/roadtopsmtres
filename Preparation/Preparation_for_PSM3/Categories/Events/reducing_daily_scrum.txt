Q: Reducing the frequency rate of the Daily Scrum would likely cause

A: Impediments are raised and resolved more slowly which might impact productivity and progress. Opportunities to inspect and adapt the sprint backlog are reduced. Less progress information will be shared causing the sprint plan to become inaccurate and reduces transparency over progress toward the sprint goal.

My answer: The opportunity to innspect and adapt will be greatly reduced. Transparency will be diminished. Also additional meetings besides the ones in the Scrum Events will need to be planned as Scrum Events create regularity and minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum.
