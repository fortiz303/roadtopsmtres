Q: 1)In Scrum, how is the complex architecture and infrstructure of a product addresseed? 2) Is there a time before the sprint that this is conceptualized and/or planned? 3) What effort is taken into account during the project?

A: In Scrum, architecture and infrastructure is addressed as Product Backlog Items. The team focuses on building architecture and infrastructure while delivering business functionality at the end of every Sprint. Sprint does not have a Sprint 0 so there is not a time before the Sprint that is conceptualized or planned. We discuss the architecture and the infrastructure during the Sprint Planning as a Team. 

Reviewed answer: 1)In Scrum, architecture and infrastructure is addressed in an interative and incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk. 2)Delaying the first Sprint to craft the architecture and infrastructure will create waste and so there is no time before the Sprint that is taken to conceptualize or plan such architecture or infrastructure. 3) The architecture and infrastructure of the product is emergent and is an ongoing discussion among the scrum team throughout the development of the product. Furthermore, it is more effective when architecture and infrastructure emerge alongside the development of business functionality.
