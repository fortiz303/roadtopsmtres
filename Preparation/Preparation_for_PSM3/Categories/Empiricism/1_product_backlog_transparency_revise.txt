Q: 1) a)What should a SM do to make the product backlog be transparent? b)How can it be structured to maximize transparency? c) Could the competing companies take advantage of the transparency of the PB?

My answer: a) The SM should place (but wouldnt it be the PO's resposibility?) in a location where those that are directly responsible for the outcome (stakeholders) can see what items have the highest value (or what is the purpose of the PB?) b) To maximize the trasparency the PB can be structured so that the team as a whole gets an opportunity to make suggestions to make it more detailed, estimable, emergennt, and prioritized. c)Competing companies would not be able to take advantage of a PB as PB items vary in size and many may require refinement.

To make the PB more transparent the SM can ensure to make the refinement activities are positive and productive.

Answer from Udemy: a) To make sure that the PB is transparent, we make sure that there is one product owner, the PB is accesible to the stakeholders and ST, and it It reflects the needs of the product and the flow of value based on the current state of the product and the market it serves. b) To maximize the trasparency the PB is Detailed, Emergent, Estimable and Prioritized. The PB items are independent, negotiable, visible, estimable, small, and testable. Items are ordered. At the top items ar. AThe ST and stakeholders should know  where they can view the PB. c) It depends on the state of the product backlog. For example, if it's highly refined and not much changes will occur then it could be used to their advantage. But if the product is still in its early stages of development, a lot of uncertainty exists, and a lot of changes will occur then it might be less of an advantage.
