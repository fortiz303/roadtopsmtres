Q: What is the value of the Team knowing it's velocity? What are it's shortcomings?

A: Velocity is only helpful to the Team when certain variables are reduced or eliminated in the ST. Those variables include their truthfulness in estimating their story size, the maturity of the Team members with Scrum (the Team members are highly self-managed, and understand empiricism). However, velocity is not an error-free indicator of the value that the ST outputs. Actually, it is very error prone and should not be viewed as a measure for the team's past successes and/or it's future success. One way that the Team can raise their velocity and artificially inflate it is by overestimating the size of the user stories.

A: Complex work is very difficult to estimate. Scrum aims to alleviate that by it's iterative and incremental solutions. Velocity aims to be an indicator of future success despite a lot of uncertainties that the Team faces. When the Team is mature and has a high degree of Empiricism, their estimated velocity can be very helpful to estimate their future success. However, velocity can be error prone as complex work is difficult to estimate. A team can also overestimate the size of the work (stories) and artificially inflate their velocity. Lastly, but not limited to, the team can run into technical debt and casue velocity to be unreliable.
