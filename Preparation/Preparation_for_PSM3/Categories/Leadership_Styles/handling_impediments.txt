A: The SM is a leader that serves and causes the removal of impediments to the Scrum Team's progess and the SM ensures that all the Scrum events that take place are positive, and productive. As a leader who serves, I would talk to the company director on how him talking on the phone is impacting the team. I'd help the company director find another place where he can make calls but not disrupt the ST.
