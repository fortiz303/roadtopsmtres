What does a typical week look like?

I will start the day by reviewing. Reviewing what?

I will look at the progress the team is making. How do you look at this progress?

As a servant leader, I keep my door always open to anybody who has questions. Qiestions about what?

I look at how the team is collaborating and look for impediments that I could address. Can you give an example of an impediment that you had to address.

I coach new developers in Agile framework. What do you tell said developers?

How many teams did you work with? (Easy question) (2)

What were those teams? (Again, easy question)

I start off every Monday by reading Agile blogs, or listening to podcasts and then thinking of ways that I can apply said knowledge into my company. I like to read Medium blogs, specifically. 

Monday mornings at the Company:

I observe the daily stand up for one of the teams. I focus on the needs and opportunities to teach mentor or coach any of the team members.
