The day we have all been waiting for has arrived. The sun is shining, roses are blooming and you have a new task at hand. That's right: new project has begun. Management tells you, as the team's new Scrum Master, to coach the team in Agile principles, as they begin to build a platform in which IT recruiters can connect to experienced DevOps engineers.

An hour before the Sprint Planning meeting, you receive an email from the Product Owner, Lucas, showing you a list of the User Stories. You take a glance:

As an IT recruiter, I want to search devopsconnect.com to find DevOps engineers.

As an IT recuiter, I want to communicate with DevOps engineers.

As an IT recruiter, I want to hire a DevOps engineer on devopsconnect.com

As an experienced Scrum Master, you realize that these stories are not defined, and know that these User stories are not concise and do not have the right focus.

Undertanding the 'why'

Instead of panicking, you know you've got to maintain your cool, talk with the PO and rewrite the User Stories as quickly as possible. Without defined and focused User Stories, the team can not possibly have a succesful Sprint Planning meeting.

A User Story is the producct of a coversation that help shift the focus from writing about requirements to talking about them. The key to User Stories is that the team discusses the features as this will be more valuable than what is written. User Stories should be short and can be explained in a sentence or two. A simple, and common template is the following:

As a "type of user," I want "some goal" so that "some goal." 

Using the above format, we can rewrite our first User Story to make it more concise, focused, and developed. We know that we want IT recruiters to use our new feature, but what kind of IT recruiter will be our target? What type of IT reruiter will benefit the most from this functionality? Busy recruiters? Nearby recuiters? For this User Story, we will go with the former.

"As a busy recruiter, I want "some feature" so that "some goal."

Now that we have defined our recruiter who is probably on a call with a potential candidate right now, we want to define the feature that recruiter may want. As some of you reading this know, in the DevOps realm, there are a plethora of technologies that DevOps engineers employ to continously improve the processes of the development. Moreover, the firms that the recruiters work with be seeking somebody that has experience with Linux operating systems or continuous integration tools like Jenkins. Whatever that may be, we can define the feature may be looking for.

"As a specialized recruiter" I want "a search feature that contains the technologies I am looking for" so that "some goal."

In the last and final phase of our User Story, we can define the goal for the User Story. Using our defined "who" and "what" we can now form the "why." We can use the following to finish writing our User Story.

"As a specialized recruiter" I want "a search feature that contains the technologies I am looking for" so that "I can message only those DevOps engineers with the experience my company needs."

And Finally!

Acceptance Criteria

What should the new functionality have in order for the user's benefit and the benfeit of the business to be met? How do we, as a Scrum Team, know when that User Story is done? In this case, the development team can define the acceptance criteria as Done when we verify that upon searching a search term, the DevOps engineers with the most expertise are listed first. We can also do the following:

Have an email sign up form where the recruiter can input their email when more engineers that match her criteria become available/sign up.

Display related technologies when a specific search term is not found to encourage the recruiter to look for engineers with expertise in similar technologies.

Display 0 results found when no DevOps engineers are found.

Conclusion

Understanding the user who will benefit from the User Story is only one part of the equation when it comes to writing a focused and concise User Story. Most importantly, we must also understand the "why," as understanding it, will maximize the value of the feature to the user. By following the above practices, we ensure that developers and customers are maximizing their time creating, and using the product.

 both the user and the business 

A good Scrum Master understands what certain features are about, a great Scrum Master understands why that feature is needed.
 



As a Scrum Master, we must ensure that the user stories are defined in a way that is specific, concise and focused.
