Q(4/15/21,11:55) Is it ok to change the Sprint Goal during the Sprint?
A: No, as a team we communicate with the PO letting them know of the repercussions of changing the Sprint Goal. This would mean that we have to cancel the current Sprint and replan with Sprint Planning a new Sprint Goal as the old Sprint Goal is obsolete. We ask the Product Owner, is changing the Sprint Goal worth it? If the PO answers yes, then we go ahead and do so. Changing a Sprint Goal and therefore starting a new Sprint sets a dangerous precedent for future Sprints and should be avoided, and if not possible, minimized to the fullest extent. As a succession, the Scrum Team will analyze why we had to change the Sprint Goal during the Sprint Retrospective. One possibility, is maybe the Sprints are too long and we need to shorten the length of them.
